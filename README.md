# Lane Detection System

This repository consists of two projects:
1) Improving the quality of a low brightness video.
2) Lane detection and turn prediction
This projects aims to do a simple lane detection to mimic lane departure warning systems used in self-driving cars. 

### Improving the video quality:
- The various concepts that were tried are:
    - [Histogram Equalization](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d4/d1b/tutorial_histogram_equalization.html)
    - [CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)](http://amroamroamro.github.io/mexopencv/opencv/clahe_demo_gui.html#3)
    - [Gamma Correction](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/10/05/opencv-gamma-correction/)

### Lane Detection and turn prediction:
- This involved the concepts of **hough transform** and **hough lines**.


Implementation approach and explanation of the concepts involved and the solution can be found in the [report](./Report.pdf).

### Instructions to run the code:
